# Design Patterns
Design patterns are common architectural approaches. They are universally relevant.

## Single Responsibility
The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should have only one reason to change. In other words, a class should have only one responsibility or job. If we adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle, 

1. We will have classes and modules that are easy to understand
2. We promote encapsulation, reusability, and testability
3. Maintenance becomes easier
