## The Template Method Design Pattern

The Template Method Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure. It's particularly useful when you have a series of steps that need to be executed in a specific order, but the implementation of each step may vary.

Template Method: It's a method in the superclass that defines the steps of the algorithm using abstract methods or hook methods. These methods represent steps of the algorithm that can be customized by subclasses.

Concrete Methods: These are methods in the superclass that implement common behavior shared by all subclasses.

Abstract Methods or Hook Methods: These are abstract methods or placeholder methods in the superclass that represent steps of the algorithm to be implemented by subclasses. Subclasses provide concrete implementations for these methods to customize the algorithm's behavior.

```csharp
using System;

// Abstract class representing a character
public abstract class Character
{
    // Template method defining the character's behavior
    public void PerformAction()
    {
        Move();
        Attack();
        InteractWithEnvironment();
    }

    // Common method
    protected void Move()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Character is moving");
    }

    // Abstract methods to be implemented by subclasses
    protected abstract void Attack();
    protected abstract void InteractWithEnvironment();
}

// Concrete subclass representing a player character
public class Player : Character
{
    protected override void Attack()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Player is attacking");
    }

    protected override void InteractWithEnvironment()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Player is interacting with the environment");
    }
}

// Concrete subclass representing an enemy character
public class Enemy : Character
{
    protected override void Attack()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Enemy is attacking");
    }

    protected override void InteractWithEnvironment()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Enemy is interacting with the environment");
    }
}

// Client code
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Player's Turn:");
        Character player = new Player();
        player.PerformAction();
        
        Console.WriteLine("\nEnemy's Turn:");
        Character enemy = new Enemy();
        enemy.PerformAction();
    }
}
```
